# Factory Methodology

This is the single canonical statement of how the agent factory works. Every SKILL.md embeds the
section below at its top, and every agent in this refactor follows it exactly. Read it first.

## How work flows (this factory's methodology — read first)

State lives in ONE place: Praxis. There are no JSON status files, no locks on disk, no self-set "done"
flags. A ticket (requirement) and a check are Praxis facts; everything about what is built/claimed/passed
is state ON THE TICKET'S Praxis node. To do ANY unit of work you follow exactly this loop:

1. FIND   — query Praxis for the next incomplete ticket in scope (incomplete = never-built | regressed |
            stale, derived from recorded outcomes). Pass the BARE project name (e.g. "team-app"); the
            endpoint adds the "prd-" prefix itself — passing "prd-team-app" returns EMPTY and silently
            hides all work.
2. CLAIM  — atomically set the ticket's meta.build_state="in_progress" with claim_owner=you + a heartbeat.
            The claim is a LEASE: refresh the heartbeat while working; a stale lease auto-reclaims so a
            dead agent never strands a ticket. Parallel agents never double-work because a live claim is
            visible to all.
3. RESOLVE— determine which checks this ticket must pass by QUERY (its tag ∪ its surfaces ∪ semantic
            match against active checks). The ticket NEVER stores its own check list. Truncate any prior
            per-check state, then PIN the freshly-resolved set onto the ticket as this pass's contract.
4. BUILD  — do the work to satisfy the ticket's acceptance condition.
5. VERIFY — run each pinned check; record each pass ON THE TICKET NODE (never on the check — checks are
            read-only during builds). External signals only; never self-judge.
6. FINISH — only when EVERY pinned check passed: record a succeeded outcome and release the lease
            (build_state="finished"). If any check fails, record a failed outcome — that regresses the
            ticket so it re-enters the FIND set and is re-done.

Praxis is a HARD dependency: if it is unreachable the factory STOPS (the gate blocks) — it never proceeds
on a guess. The single Stop gate (build_completeness) enforces this loop: it blocks the turn from ending
while you hold an unfinished claim or scoped incomplete tickets remain.
