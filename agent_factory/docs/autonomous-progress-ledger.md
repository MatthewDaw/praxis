## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE MET (2026-06-26, Pass 12)

All four CONSTITUTION §1 conditions hold (scoped per episode `82608710`):

1. **Product built + working locally** — every in-scope PRD requirement implemented in `team-app`
   (R1–R14, §8 metrics, §2C habits, §6 admin) with a runnable entry point (`python -m team_app.app`)
   and **84/84 tests green**. Out-of-local-scope (infra/UI, documented): auth/login, DB
   persistence, web/mobile UI, offline sync, deployment.
2. **Plan hardened** — 15 requirement atomic facts in `prd-team-app` (@30 nodes incl. episodes),
   each with a binary acceptance condition, **zero unresolved contradictions**.
3. **Tooling hardened** — all 4 `coding_factory` evals **GREEN** (re-verified) + **48/48**
   write-policy unit tests; live `:8000` on fixed code.
4. **Learnings compounded** — per-requirement `record_outcome` + impl/decision episodes; 4
   captured→fixed→verified-green evals prove the Praxis write-path.

**Loop status:** the build objective is complete. The 15-min cron (`797c0c14`) may keep firing;
each fire will run the §1b gate (re-verify if praxis HEAD ≠ `5370659`) and find no remaining
in-scope build slice — i.e. it idles cleanly. **To stop the loop, run `CronDelete 797c0c14`** (or
end the session). Optional future work, only if desired: wire the §6 admin/roster store into the
entry point demo; add an integration test spanning roster→submissions→participation→streak end
to end; or pull any of the out-of-scope infra items into scope.

`prd-team-app` snapshot @30 nodes; R10 stays `rejected`; R14 realized in code (`df98fd8b`).
Praxis HEAD recorded for §1b gate: `5370659`.

## Product build status (team-app: C:/Users/mattd/Documents/gauntlet/team-app)

**Git:** repo initialized this session; baseline (R1–R3, 14 green) committed on branch
**`feat/team-app-build`** (off `main`). Commit each slice here; do not push.


| Req | Feature | Code | Status |
|-----|---------|------|--------|
| R1  | Daily completion | `team_app/completion.py` | ✅ built, green |
| R2  | Participation %  | `team_app/participation.py` | ✅ built, green |
| R3  | Active roster    | `team_app/roster.py` | ✅ built, green |
| R4  | Team streak (≥70%) | `team_app/streak.py` | ✅ built, green |
| R5  | Team-day boundary (3AM) | `team_app/day_boundary.py` | ✅ built, green |
| R6  | Athlete visibility (aggregate only) | `team_app/roles.py`+`views.py` | ✅ built, green |

| R12 | Daily prompt | `team_app/content.py` | ✅ built, green |
| R13 | Notifications | `team_app/notifications.py` | ✅ built, green |
| R14 | Data model wiring | (in code via stores) | ✅ realized in code (episode `df98fd8b`) |
| —   | Role permission logic (PRD §1) | `team_app/roles.py` | ✅ built (login/auth = infra, out-of-local-scope) |
| —   | Local runnable entry point | `team_app/app.py` | ✅ built, green (`python -m team_app.app`) |
| §8  | Metrics (activation/retention/adherence/distribution/drop-off) | `team_app/metrics.py` | ✅ built, green |
| §2C | Team habit checklist store (TeamHabits) | `team_app/habits.py` | ✅ built, green |
| §6  | Admin mutations (roster active/inactive, captain assignment) | `team_app/admin.py` | ✅ built, green |
| —   | Auth/login, DB persistence, web/mobile UI, offline sync, deploy | — | 🚫 out-of-local-scope (infra; CONSTITUTION §6) |

Test suite: **84 passing** (… + app 5 + metrics 5 + habits 6 + admin 6) as of last build.

## Plan status (Praxis `agent-factory` org / `prd-team-app` snapshot)

Requirements admitted live: R1–R9, R11–R13 (12 requirements, each one atomic fact). R10 rejected
(leaderboard, lost to R6). R14 intentionally not a standalone fact (in code; episode `df98fd8b`).
Decisions recorded as episodes. `general-pool` mounted read-only. `prd-team-app` snapshot current
at **15 nodes** (re-saved Pass 1).

## Tooling: evals captured / fixed

| Eval (praxis `coding_factory/`) | Captures | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `requirement_not_fragmented_by_distillation` | multi-sentence req splits per sentence | ✅ **GREEN** (atomic insights, #97) |
| `contradicting_requirement_not_merged` | Augmenter merges a contradicting req (defeats `surface`) | ✅ **GREEN** (Augmenter contradiction guard, #97) |
| `tabular_field_not_merged_into_incumbent` | tabular fact merges into overlapping incumbent | ✅ **GREEN** (Augmenter guard, #97) |
| `derived_learning_not_merged_into_source` | derived learning merges into source | ✅ **GREEN** (feat/derived-no-merge, `c0da203`) |

**ALL FOUR captured bugs are FIXED and verified GREEN** (2026-06-26 Pass 4) — the parallel
Praxis agent's fixes landed in praxis `main` (`f381109` Augmenter contradiction guard + atomic
insights #97; `c0da203` derived-no-merge; `ee76f75` update_fact category). Verified via the
direct-check method against current code; **48/48 write-policy unit tests pass (no regression)**;
`:8000` restarted so the live factory path runs the fix.

**Praxis HEAD at last verify: `5370659`.** Tooling-health gate (CONSTITUTION §1b): each pass, if
praxis HEAD ≠ this, re-verify the eval suite + write-policy tests and harden any RED to GREEN
before building; then update this line.

**Known OPEN (not ours to fix): `matt_tax_return_ruleset_distillation`** — a real compound-rule
distillation loss in the tax domain; a `SPLIT_PROMPT` fix regressed 9 recall checks and was
reverted (§12). Tax domain — leave alone per owner constraint.

---

## Verified mechanics (use these; don't rediscover)

- **Praxis eval check — fast, no side effects (validated 3x this session):** call the check
  directly with the case params:
  `praxis/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'.'); from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv('.env'); from knowledge.evals.deterministic_checks.graph import <check> as c; print(c(None, **params).passed)"`
  (run from the praxis repo). Reproduces against the real write policy via the live `.env`
  (Postgres :5433 + OpenRouter); does NOT write cassettes. Prefer this for RED/GREEN confirmation.
- The full harness runner (CONSTITUTION §11, `python -m knowledge.evals.run <id> --openrouter`)
  also works but **write-throughs cassette fixtures** into the praxis tree — extra index noise
  while another agent is active there; use only when you need the harness's grading/SKIP logic.
- **team-app tests:** `cd team-app && python -m pytest -q` (baseline 14 green).
- **Praxis backend health:** `curl 127.0.0.1:8000/health` → 200 (PID was 5764; restart per §13
  after any praxis code fix — the MCP just proxies to :8000).

## Decisions log (owned, low-regret; owner may override)

- Streak threshold = **≥70%** of active roster (PRD §3 worked example). Episode recorded
  (`64456c97…`). Alternatives: 50% / 80% / 100%.
- Checklist is **optional** for completion (PRD-recommended; does not gate completion).
- N=0 participation = **None / "no active roster"**, never 0 (conventional default; PRD silent).
- Privacy (R6) **wins** over an athlete-visible completion leaderboard (R10) — PRD §5 privacy is
  non-negotiable; R10 rejected via `resolve_contradiction`.

## Open issues / watch-outs

- **Index hygiene (CONSTITUTION §9):** praxis repo has concurrent agent WIP + the owner's
  tax-return work staged. Commit eval/fix files with explicit pathspec only. One contaminated
  commit already happened this session and was corrected — do not repeat.
- Known-bug workarounds in effect (single-sentence requirements, etc.) — CONSTITUTION §8.

## Pass history

- **2026-06-26 Pass 12 (DoD MET):** §1b gate clean. Built **§6 admin mutations**
  (`team_app/admin.py`: RosterStore + coach-only set_active/assign_captain, deny-by-default;
  flows to active_roster→participation; 6 tests). Suite **84 green**. Admitted R-ADMIN (`d5e10a39`,
  added clean) + episode `cf36de4f` + `record_outcome`. Commit `e78cd0c`. Then ran the **scoped DoD
  audit**: all 4 evals re-verified GREEN, 48/48 write-policy tests, 0 contradictions, snapshot
  re-saved @30 nodes → **Definition of Done MET**. No bug. Loop objective complete.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 11:** §1b gate clean. Built **§2C team habit checklist** (`team_app/habits.py`:
  TeamHabitsStore one active 3-6 unique-item list per team + checked_items; recorded, never gates
  completion per R1 — confirmed by test; 6 tests). Suite 78 green. Admitted R-HABITS (`c2efa4f6`,
  added clean) + episode `4540425b` + `record_outcome`. Commit `4704dae`. No bug. Next: §6 admin mutations.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 10:** §1b gate clean. Built **§8 metrics** (`team_app/metrics.py`: activation,
  retention day3/day7, adherence ≥4/week, participation distribution, drop-off point — pure
  read-only functions; 5 tests). Suite 72 green. Admitted requirement R-METRICS (`9d0995be`,
  added clean) + episode `fc67c6e7` + `record_outcome`. Commit `487942d`. No bug. Next: §2C habit checklist.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 9:** §1b gate clean. Built the **runnable one-screen entry point**
  (`team_app/app.py`: `TeamApp.assemble_one_screen` wires R2/R4/R6/R7/R9/R11/R12 + trend; role-gated;
  `python -m team_app.app` runs; 5 tests). Suite 67 green. Episodes `5abcbbf1` (entry point) +
  `82608710` (DoD scope boundary). Commit `c969643`. Re-saved snapshot @23 nodes, 0 contradictions.
  **DoD audit: behavioral core complete but PRD not 100%** — remaining in-scope logic: §8 metrics,
  §2C habit checklist, §6 admin mutations; infra/UI declared out-of-local-scope. Did NOT declare
  DoD met. Next: §8 metrics.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 8:** §1b gate: praxis HEAD unchanged (`5370659`) → tooling green, skipped.
  Built **R13 notifications** (`team_app/notifications.py`: ≤1 daily + ≤1 streak-save per
  athlete/day, idempotent, non-shaming copy enforced by a marker-blocklist test; 7 tests). Suite
  62 green. Episode `be9a2cb2` + `record_outcome(R13)`. Commit `9e79c8d`. No bug. **All behavioral
  reqs R1–R13 now built.** Next: the runnable entry point + DoD audit.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 7:** §1b gate: praxis HEAD unchanged (`5370659`) → tooling green, skipped.
  Built **R11 weekly theme + R12 daily prompt** (`team_app/content.py`: WeeklyThemeStore +
  DailyPromptStore, one-per-key upsert, response_type validation; 9 tests). Suite 55 green.
  Episode `efcd8d4c` + `record_outcome(R11, R12)`. Commit `d087778`. No bug. Next: R13.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 6:** §1b gate: praxis HEAD unchanged (`5370659`) → tooling still green,
  skipped re-verify. Built **R9 captain/coach message + optional approval** (`team_app/messages.py`:
  role-gated post, coach-only approve, team-scoped visibility, single-active-captain supersede,
  expiry; 8 tests). Suite 46 green. Episode `5282659b` + `record_outcome(R9)`. Commit `a10d465`.
  No bug. Next: R11/R12/R13.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 5:** Switched loop cadence to **every 15 min** (cron `797c0c14`; old
  `1defb1e0` deleted; cron prompt now runs the §1b gate first). Built **R6/R7 role-aware
  visibility** (`team_app/roles.py` + `views.py`; `SubmissionStore.for_day_by_user`; 5 tests —
  athlete/captain aggregate-only, coach per-athlete, deny-by-default, store integration). Suite
  38 green. Episode `942cc8d9` + `record_outcome(R6, R7)`. Commit `5714947`. No bug. Next: R9.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 4 (HARDEN — tooling to 100%):** Owner flagged the loop wasn't closing evals.
  Checked praxis git: the parallel agent's fixes had **landed** (`f381109` Augmenter contradiction
  guard + atomic insights #97; `c0da203` derived-no-merge; `ee76f75` update_fact category; HEAD
  `5370659`). Re-verified **all 4 captured evals → GREEN** (direct-check); **48/48 write-policy
  unit tests pass** (no regression); **restarted `:8000`** (stale PID 5764 → 16792) so the live
  path runs the fix. Added the **§1b tooling-health gate** to the constitution (re-verify evals
  whenever praxis HEAD changes; harden RED→GREEN before building). No team-app build this pass —
  tooling-first per owner. Next: resume build at R6/R7 with tooling confirmed green.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 3:** Built **R8 submission idempotency** (`team_app/submissions.py`:
  `SubmissionStore` upsert per (user_id, team_day); 7 tests incl. an R8→R2 integration proving a
  retry stays at 50%). Suite 33 green. Episode `4dde8215` + `record_outcome(R8)`. Commit `7967d51`.
  No bug. Next: R6/R7 visibility + roles.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 2:** Built **R5 team-day boundary** (`team_app/day_boundary.py`:
  `team_day(local_dt, reset_hour=3)`; 6 tests incl. midnight rollback + month boundary). Suite 26
  green. Episode `c57ff10e` + `record_outcome(R5)`. Commit `994ecfb`. No bug.
- **2026-06-26 Pass 1 (first loop pass):** Cleaned the polluted graph (repaired R5 + R8 via
  `edit_fact`; rejected+deleted the 3 stray R14 field-facts; re-saved snapshot @15 nodes). R14
  hit the known Augmenter merge into R8 → repaired R8, recorded decision to keep R14 in code
  only (episode `df98fd8b`). Built **R4 team streak** (`team_app/streak.py`, 6 tests, suite 20
  green); recorded impl episode `9b715f1e` + `record_outcome(R4, succeeded)`. Committed team-app
  `458aa4d`. No new bug (the R14 merge is already covered by `tabular_field_not_merged_into_incumbent`).
  Next: R5.
- **2026-06-26 (session prior to loop):** Established constitution + ledger. Ran the planning
  loop over the team-app PRD; found and captured 3 new Praxis edge cases as RED evals
  (fragmentation, contradiction-merge, tabular-merge); verified recall/episodes/snapshot/
  mount/contradiction-surface+resolve/bulk-write/H1 all healthy. R1–R3 already built+green from
  earlier. Left at the NEXT pointer above.
